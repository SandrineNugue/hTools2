Keyboard shortcuts
==================

By default, hTools scripts are accessible in RoboFont via the `Extensions` section of the main application menu.

In addition to that, it is also possible to assign custom keyboard shortcuts to script calls. This makes it even faster to run commonly used scripts.

The table below gives an overview of the keyboard shortcuts I use:

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>m</td>
		<td>move selected glyphs</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>w</td>
		<td>skew selected glyphs</td>
	</tr>
		<td>n</td>
		<td>nudge selected points</td>
	</tr>
</table>
