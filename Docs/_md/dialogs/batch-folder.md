## Batch folder

#### actions.py

![folder actions](../_imgs/dialogs_folder_actions.png "folder actions")

Selectively apply a few common actions to all fonts in a given folder.

#### generate.py

![generate folder](../_imgs/dialogs_folder_generate.png "generate folder")

Generates `otf` fonts from all `ufos` in the selected `ufos folder`. It is also possible to select a second folder as the destination for the `otfs`; if no `otfs folder` is set, the fonts will be generated in the same folder as the `ufos`.

#### otfs2ufos.py

![otfs2ufos](../_imgs/dialogs_folder_otfs2ufos.png "otfs2ufos")

Converts all `otf` fonts in the selected `otfs folder` to the `ufo` format. Use the `ufos folder` button to select a separate folder for the `ufo` files, or simply apply the action â€“ if no `ufos folder` is set, the fonts will be generated in the same folder as the source `otfs`.
