## Introduction

hTools is a collection of [Python](http://python.org/) scripts, tools and objects for type-design & font-production work. It includes a set of dialogs specially tailored for use with [RoboFont](http://robofont.com/), and core Python modules and objects which can also be used with [FontLab Studio](http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontlab-studio/) and NoneLab (pure Python).

hTools is built with [RoboFab](http://robofag.org/) and [vanilla](http://code.typesupply.com/wiki/Vanilla). It uses the [UFO](http://unifiedfontobject.org/) font format to store font sources, and [plist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_list) files to store different kinds of font data.

hTools2 is the second incarnation of hTools – the first one was never released. Read more about the project’s history in the [alpha release announcement](http://hipertipo.com/blog/htools-2-alpha-release/).
