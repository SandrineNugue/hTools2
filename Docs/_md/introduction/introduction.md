hTools is a collection of [Python](#) scripts, tools and objects for type-design & font-production work. It includes a set of dialogs specially tailored for use with [RoboFont](#), and core Python modules and objects which can also be used with [FontLab Studio](#) and NoneLab (pure Python).

hTools is built with [RoboFab](#) and [vanilla](#). It uses the [UFO](#) font format to store font sources, and [plist](#) files to store different kinds of font data.

hTools2 is the second incarnation of hTools – the first one was never released. Read more about the project’s history in the [alpha release announcement](#).
