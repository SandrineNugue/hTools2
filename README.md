*...Work has just started, not much to see at the moment...*

Looking forward to [RoboThon 2012](http://twitter.com/#!/robothonconf).

If you would like to support hTools development, consider [comissioning more work](mailto:gustavo@hipertipo.com?subject=custom-scripts-and-tools) on custom or additional tools and functionality.


Installation
------------

To install hTools2, first download and unzip the [latest package](https://github.com/gferreira/hTools2/zipball/master) from the [repository on github](https://github.com/gferreira/hTools2).

Then:

1. Move the folder to the desired location on your hard disk (for example `/code/`)
2. Create a simple text file named `hTools2.pth` with the path to the `Lib` folder in hTools2: `/code/hTools2/Lib/`.
3. Save this file in the `site-packages` folder for the current Python, for example `/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages`.

That’s it.

To test if hTools2 is installed, try to run this in the RoboFont scripting window:

    import hTools2
    
If no error message is returned, we’re good to go.
