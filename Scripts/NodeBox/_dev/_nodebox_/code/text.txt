Elementar is a parametric font system
designed to bring more typographic
flexibility to digital screens. Elementar
embraces and explores the unique properties
of digital media: the pixel and the coarse
resolution grid, the dimension of time, and
the powers of computation. Elementar 1.0
comes in 3 styles, each with hundreds of
fonts in many heights, weights and widths.
